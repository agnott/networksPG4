Notes
- All components of the program worked at one point, but the file requesting inexplicably broke and after debugging for over 5 hours, we could not figure out how to fix this issue. It works for SmallFile.txt, but the medium and large files do not. Uploading worked fine, as did the other functions, but we simply could not spend any more time on this as we have other work and exams to handle. 
- Total Time Taken: 12 hours
